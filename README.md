# JS-like-HTMLParser
HTML Parser made by me, much simplier than the builtin version. It includes the DOM class which has a structure similar to the JavaScript element one. Work in progress...
(There are probably better option but I wanted to do it by myself)

Possible future updates:
-Style/CSS analysis
-JS analysis
-PHP analysis (distant future)
